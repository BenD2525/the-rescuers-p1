# The Rescuers

The Rescuers is a fictional dog rehoming service based in London, UK. 

The service currently has 4 dogs, although more could be added in future. This website aims to both find a home for the dogs in need, and also educate prospective dog-adopters on the benefits of having a dog. The target audience for the website is anyone who would like to adopt a dog, and anyone who is interested in learning about the benefits of adopting a dog. 

To meet the needs of this target audience, the website contains information on the health benefits of owning a dog, as well as why rescuing a dog is important. The website also contains an 'about us' page which contains information regarding the charity's history, mission and values. There is a 'meet the dogs' page which serves to showcase pictures of the current dogs that need re-homing, as well as a bio on each one. Lastly, the website also has a 'contact us' page with a form to enquire about a certain dog, and some information on when the inbox for enquiries is monitored.

## About Us page

This page serves to educate the user about the history, mission and values of the dog rehoming service. The history section provides a brief history of the service, and how they came to be. The mission section states a clear purpose for the service, with 3 key goals. The values section details the values that the service holds dear, and how they aim to act.

![About Us section](https://github.com/BenD2525/the-rescuers-p1/blob/main/documentation/about-us.PNG "Screenshot of About Us section")

## Come and see us section

At the bottom of the About Us page, there is an iframe from Google maps, with a fictional location for the service. The location has been chosen because it is not specific to anyone's address, and a park would be a relatively realistic location for a dog-homing service, allowing for easy dog exercising.

## Meet the Dogs page 

This page will allow the user to view and read about each of the 4 dogs which the service has available for rehoming. The section contains 4 images which have been re-sized to ensure uniformity. Next to each image is a bio for each dog, which provides some information about each dog.

## Contact us form

Located on contact-us.html, this form allows the user to input their first name, last name and email address in order to contact the service. There are 4 radio buttons which are mutually exclusive so that the service will know which dog the user is enquiring about. Each field is required, and if the user attempts to click the 'Contact Us' button to submit their information without filling out each field, they will receive a message asking them to fill in the necessary detail.
