The target audience for the website is anyone who would like to adopt a dog, and anyone who is interested in learning about the benefits of adopting a dog. 

To meet the needs of this target audience, the website contains information on the health benefits of owning a dog, as well as why rescuing a dog is important. The website also contains an 'about us' page which contains information regarding the charity's history, mission and values.

### Come and see us section

At the bottom of the About Us page, there is an iframe from Google maps, with a fictional location for the service.
