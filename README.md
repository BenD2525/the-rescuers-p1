# The Rescuers

The Rescuers is a fictional dog rehoming service based in London, UK. 

The service currently has 4 dogs, although more could be added in future. This website aims to both find a home for the dogs in need, and also educate prospective dog-adopters on the benefits of having a dog. The target audience for the website is anyone who would like to adopt a dog, and anyone who is interested in learning about the benefits of adopting a dog. 

To meet the needs of this target audience, the website contains information on the health benefits of owning a dog, as well as why rescuing a dog is important. The website also contains an 'about us' page which contains information regarding the charity's history, mission and values. There is a 'meet the dogs' page which serves to showcase pictures of the current dogs that need re-homing, as well as a bio on each one. Lastly, the website also has a 'contact us' page with a form to enquire about a certain dog, and some information on when the inbox for enquiries is monitored.

![Tagline image](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/tagline.PNG)

## Dogs in Need section

The 'Dogs in Need' section allows the user to see information regarding why it is better to rehome a rescue dog, than to buy a puppy. There is also an icon of a dog which alludes to what the section is about. Next to the section, there is a picture of a dog, which ensures a consistent theme.

![Footer](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/footer.PNG)

## About Us page

This page serves to educate the user about the history, mission and values of the dog rehoming service. The history section provides a brief history of the service, and how they came to be. The mission section states a clear purpose for the service, with 3 key goals. The values section details the values that the service holds dear, and how they aim to act.

![About Us section](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/about-us.PNG)

## Come and see us section

At the bottom of the About Us page, there is an iframe from Google maps, with a fictional location for the service. The location has been chosen because it is not specific to anyone's address, and a park would be a relatively realistic location for a dog-homing service, allowing for easy dog exercising.

![Come and See us section](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/come-and-see-us.PNG)

## Meet the Dogs page 

This page will allow the user to view and read about each of the 4 dogs which the service has available for rehoming. The section contains 4 images which have been re-sized to ensure uniformity. Next to each image is a bio for each dog, which provides some information about each dog.

![Meet the dogs 1](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/meet-the-dogs-1.PNG)
![Meet the dogs 2](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/meet-the-dogs-2.PNG)

## Contact us form

Located on contact-us.html, this form allows the user to input their first name, last name and email address in order to contact the service. There are 4 radio buttons which are mutually exclusive so that the service will know which dog the user is enquiring about. Each field is required, and if the user attempts to click the 'Contact Us' button to submit their information without filling out each field, they will receive a message asking them to fill in the necessary detail.

![Contact Us](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/contact-us.PNG)

## Response times section

Located on contact-us.html, this table allows the user to see the times that they can expect a response. Above the table, there is a sentence which provides rationale for the below times being provided.This ensures a better user experience, because their expectations of turnaround times are fully managed.

![Response Times](../the-rescuers-p1/assets/screenshots/response-times.PNG)

## Thankyou

This page serves to acknowledge that the user's enquiry has been received, and that the service will get back to the user shortly.

# Features Left to Implement

## Gallery 

A separate page showing a gallery of dog pictures and videos

## Volunteering 

A separate page which allows the user to access advice and links with information about how to fundraise or volunteer. This would include articles and links to different fundraising ideas.

# Testing

## Browser compatibility

Initial testing was done using Google Developer Tools while coding the project. Links, images, presentation and different screen sizes were all checked using this tool.

When the website was deployed, I was able to check the site on mobile devices, and identified some bugs.

* Meet the dogs page- Images and bios were squashed together
* About us page- Mission contents weren't aligned
* Home page- Pictures lacked margin

These were all fixed with the small screen media queries.

Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari all display content and images correctly and all links work and open in new windows.

The form correctly sends the user to the thankyou page once the data is submitted, and the form data validation works correctly.
I attempted to submit without filling out each field, and was presented with a message to fill out the required data (First name, Last name, Email).
When attempting to use a non-valid email address in the email field, the relevant error message appeared asking to use the correct format.

This was tested on a laptop, PC, iPad, Iphone SE, Galaxy S8 and a Motorola G9. 

## Accessibility

The site has been checked using Google Lighthouse, with a score of 100 for accessibility.
