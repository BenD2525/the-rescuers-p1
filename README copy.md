Validator Testing
HTML

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
