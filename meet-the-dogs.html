            <h2>Rossi</h2>
            <p>Rossi is an old boy, but very loving. He was born in Greece and spent the first year of his life there as
                a hunting dog before coming over to the UK. He has been well looked after but now is the time for him to
                find a new home.
                He is old and so does not require too much exercise, and likes his peace and quiet. If you would like a
                quiet, funny, loyal friend then Rossi is for you.

            <h2>Lucy</h2>
            <p>Lucy is a young lady who had a difficult start in life. She was found abandoned in a park when she was a
                puppy and has been with us ever since. She is very energetic and loves to play, she would be well suited
                to a family with young children.

            <h2>Bob</h2>
            <p>Bob is a ball of energy. He was given to us when his owner died in 2020 and his family could no longer
                care for him. He loves to run around and socialise with other dogs. He can be fearful of humans so will
                need some patience, however he is a loving boy who would make a great companion.

            <h2>Charlie</h2>
            <p>Charlie is our oldest dog, and suffers with arthritis having had a tough life before we took care of him.
                He was used in dog fights and has been traumatised as a result. Understandably, he is very wary of new
                people and would need to be with an older family with a lot of patience.
